## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. The following code can be edited via the git procedure taught in this tutorial. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### Top 10 Strongest Heroes

```{r cars}

marvel_stats %>%
  filter(Alignment == "good") %>%
  arrange(desc(Total)) %>%
  head(10)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
